![startscreen](pics/splash.png)

Feed the creature and keep a balance between life and death.

The objective of the game is to feed a multicellular creature. 

Cells eat particles. 

The flow of particles is regulated by moving the generator and the receptor. 

If the creature does not feed it gets nervous and tries to capture the particles so as not to die.
